# Simple Google App Script Client Management System 

A proof of concept that you can use Google App Script with Sheets as a database-like CRM system. 

HOW TO: 

Provide sheet IDs for Client and User sheet. Just create two new Google Sheets and copy the ID from the URL.
For example: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/THIS_IS_YOUR_ID

Give it access to your Drive Account when asked. 
IMPORTANT: leave the first row BLANK or provide row names like "id, name, address, etc" for your data. 

This feautres address validation via the built in Google Maps Geocoder API. 
Address validation works only for German addresses as this was built for a German company. 

Click on 'Add Client' to see it.
